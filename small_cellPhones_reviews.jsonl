{"rating":5.0,"title":"Worked but took an hour to install","text":"Overall very happy with the end result. If you hate puzzles don\u2019t do it. I love puzzles and it worked for me. Took a lot of concentration and attention to detail and about an hour! The YouTube video helped a ton with installing the new screen. Highly recommend using a how to video when replacing your screen. The tools and supplies they provided were adequate. I did use additional tools from my home to successfully installed a new screen. My screws on the inside of the iPhone were stuck and I had to use an X-Acto knife to get them to come out. The glass Screen for the iPhone was beautiful and worked great. The screen protector that was additional came cracked (Not a big deal as it was extra in my eyes). I did need to use the X-Acto knife to cut off part of a plastic piece to make the final fit. So yes I modified the screen and instructions but ended up working great for me.<br \/><br \/>I was very careful with all of the circuit boards and connections as recommended on the YouTube video. My screen replacement was very successful and I\u2019m very happy with how it turned out.","images":[{"small_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/B1+g-o0qHKS._SL256_.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/B1+g-o0qHKS._SL800_.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/B1+g-o0qHKS._SL1600_.jpg","attachment_type":"IMAGE"}],"asin":"B088DR7Z5B","parent_asin":"B0BBGGC8F2","user_id":"AGCI7FAH4GL5FI65HYLKWTMFZ2CQ","timestamp":1629235304798,"helpful_vote":3,"verified_purchase":true}
