This is a much hardier case, and the aesthetic design really is for the sake of providing the most protection possible. I didn't think I would ever use the kickstand, but I ended up using it all the time, and it's so convenient to have it there. I initially thought it might get in the way, but it doesn't at all. The only qualm I have with this case, is that it doesn't allow me to use the original moto G4 charger that came with the phone. The bulky input end of the cable can't get past the cases area around the charging input slot, so I have to pop the case off whenever I want to use that charger. Other chords with thin ends work fine, but to not be able to use the original chord is pretty annoying, and a tedious design flaw. I would otherwise very much recommend this case, and I would re-buy this 100% next time I need a case, which I can't imagine I ever will, since this case seems like it will last forever!

I've dropped my Moto G4 twice already since putting this case on it .. and the problem here is that both of those drops were mostly due to the case. This product is 2 pieces, a semi-soft plastic liner (the colored bits in the pictures) and a hard plastic shell that goes over it. The hard plastic shell (the black parts in the pictures) is very slippery, waffle pattern notwithstanding. The ridges and waffles make it easy to hold in your hand without using a death grip, but they provide absolutely no traction when placing the phone on any surface. Both of my post-encasement drops occurred because I set the phone on my leg while sitting and the phone just slid right off and onto the floor. The phone's regular plastic back has more friction than this case. The kickstand works well, the case fits perfectly, the openings for headset port, usb port, backside mike, and camera are properly aligned & sized.",[],B01FG1QDQM,B01FG1QDQM,AFXV2JNFQ3CTZCWZL45FUBCSB3BA,1480031985000,1,True

I've since gotten a new phone and new case, and I bought another one because I can't stand holding a phone without it now. I do attach them to my case and not my phone itself, because I refuse to not have a case with impact-resistant rubber. I now also refuse to own a phone without one of these! The adhesion is flawless; I am pretty sure I couldn't get it off the case if I wanted to. I've never had an issue with it coming loose. At first the strap is a little snug, but it stretches out. This thing is BRILLIANT because I can hook my finger through the loop and let my phone hang on the back of my hand, which frees up my hands for other things I might need to carry. I might have a coffee mug in my hand, but my phone hooked to my finger on the same hand.

3027950,5.0,Built tough yet sleek.,"Case is very durable yet very non-intrusive from a front angle, as in it is bulkier on the back than it is in the front. It provides a great subtle outlining while still protecting the corners. Much easier to slide on than it is to take off, making it trustable to put in your pocket or small zipper pocket without worrying about the phone falling out. The kickstand in the back is durable as well, but do not be startled if you can't pull it out the first time you try; it is held in place by one tab on the left side, with no tab on the right, so one side will lift higher than the other when trying to prop it up. Don't worry, you won't break it by giving it a good tug to get it out of there. To clarify on the description a bit, the colored area of the case is rubber, while the back piece with the kickstand is tough plastic. Both work together well and I've had no problem with them becoming unattached to each other, they fit snuggly. Craftsmanship is great and I've no qualms with it in any aspect.",[],B01FG1QDQM,B01FG1QDQM,AE55TOX7XTBPU4E7U5UY66QZATMA,1469217337000,43,True

3147996,1.0,"Wanted to like, but slicker than ice","The case appears to be sufficiently bulky for withstanding falls. And because it is plastic, it is very light. The kickstand is nice. You'll definitely want a screen protector - the front doesn't stick out far from the screen, so a drop on a uneven surface (like a gravel driveway) will definitely shatter the screen. The one feature that I really don't like is its plastic construction. Rather than being grippy, like it looks like it should be, it's actually fairly slick. I imagine it would slide down a slight incline rather than stay in place. So, this definitely isn't the rubbery-feeling plastic but rather the slick kind. Which means it will slide off your leg. So, good think it looks like it can withstand a fall.. Update: really wanted to like it but can't after using for a day. Save your money. Too slick. It slides off of almost every surface. Low speed turns in vehicle, sinks, thigh..every surface is turned into an ice rink.",[],B01FG1QC8G,B01FG1QC8G,AHMGDLF655IPWFX2YAWYZGB2FF5Q,1480712467000,1,True

3195203,3.0,"Minimal Case, Decent Protection","I really wanted to like this case more. It’s super thin, wraps around my phone, and provides a glass screen protector. It’s also less than $20. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, not so much. Pros: • It’s super slim. It pops right on and off without any worry • Drop protection (albeit very limited) • The branding is understated and classy. Cons: • The plastic is super cheap. I was afraid of breaking it when sliding it on and off my phone, and it actually ended up leaving some minor scratches. • It doesn’t stay on very well. I dropped my phone twice with this case on. Both times, the front piece of the case came flying off. It’s a miracle that the screen didn’t break because of this. I really wanted to like this case more. But it may just be my tastes. It may be slim, but you sacrifice a LOT of protection for it. It’s basically a skin for your iPhone, just easier to install and it comes with a screen protector. If you’re into that kind of thing, then this might be for you. EDIT: 9/23/17 Customer service contacted me and offered to send me a replacement unit. From the replacement I received it looks like my first case was in some way defective. The new unit did solve the problem of the plastic popping off when I dropped it, but it’s still very thin.

Additionally, I'd like it if the inner rubber case was a little more pliable, but maybe I'm used to the feel of cases I've owned in the past. So far this case has protected my phone from at least 2-3 drops so maybe having a more rigid inner case is a good thing. For clarification, this is a 2 piece case; the first wrap around case is slightly more rigid than other cases of the same style. The button pads work great and are lined up perfectly. The outer case snaps around the 4 corners and includes the kickstand. The stand is great on its side. No vertical stand position tho. The look and feel of the case is higher quality than cases I've had in the past from this price range. Admittedly, my expectations were exceeded when I opened and installed the case.

I dropped the phone onto the concrete on its corner with the previous thinner case and there was no damage, so I'm sure this thicker case will be even better. Case is gorgeous. The only & 34;down side& 34; is that the black color makes it easy to lose the phone when in low light conditions against dark surfaces like on the car floor, on black sheets, etc. It's totally worth it though! UPDATE: The satin finish starts to peel after just a few weeks of use. It's looking pretty shabby after about 4 weeks of use (see pic). The Happy Hours case didn't peel anything like this bad after 6 months of use.

The main photo of the product doesn’t show a logo that’s why I bought it. Update: I changed my review from 3 to 4 stars. Below is my reason: It’s been more than a week since I got the ring holder and it’s holding up very well. I dropped my phone on the ground and the ring holder is still intact. I also realized the ring is turnable so you can adjust it to different angles based on your need. Few days ago, a representative from Attom Tech reached out to me due to my review about the logo. He explained that the newest versions don’t have a logo on them, however, since Amazon warehouses still have the older versions left, customers might receive the ones with a logo. The representative offered to send me another one just to see if I would get the newer version. He/she didn’t ask me to revise my review for the service. I received a new ring holder today as promised but sadly, it still has a logo on it. However, due to their proactive customer service, they should receive a better rating than a 3-star. I will wait for a bit and re-purchase again since I really like the quality of the material, hopefully, I will receive a new version next time. TL;DR: If you don’t mind having a logo on the ring holder, you should get it. It’s sturdy and thin (about 1/8 of a inch). And if you have any questions about the product, you can trust that the company has great customer service that’s willing to work things out with you.

8131150,5.0,PERFECT for Moto g4,"PERFECT for Moto g4! It is NOT as bulky as it looks in the pic. It's more like a slim case with grip. Some reviewers have mentioned they thought it was going to be softer on the sides. One reviewer said it & 34;hurt& 34; their fingers to hold! NOT TRUE! The phone fits snugly into the color piece which has a little give and the black piece snaps into place over that which is a firmer hold. I live in Florida where it gets hot and hot means in and out of air conditioning, hot cars, the sun which leads to warm, sometimes sweaty hands and condensation. The sides of this case are SO GREAT FOR GRIP! It might not be spongy like some of the silicone cases but those can get slippery. Instead of making the back smooth they added a texture, again, for better grip and control. The kick stand lays very flat when in place. Some said it was hard to unlatch or open but, yet again, my husband who has NO nails ( LOL ) had no problem getting it open. I bought an Ailun glass screen protector for Moto g4 and it fits beautifully and was super easy to install ( Amazon ). Then I installed this case. It's picture perfect. Really. This review is coming from an unfortunately ( sometimes ) terribly OCD analytical female. Trust me, I spent a good week searching and researching cases all over the internet. Poor husband, right?

But after that it loosens right up and looks like a janitors keychain at the back of ur phone within the day. After that, after using it (quite uncomfortably) for about 2 days it just ""snapped."" Boom. Done. Wow. Cool. That was worth it. Folks, truth is u cant get a slim phone ring and expect it to be comfy so maybe that's not all thier fault. But the build quality starts to lack when u make it slim too and u just end up with a piece of metal at the end of the day. Just save ur money and either buy a pop socket or just buy a larger phone ring. They truly arent ""THAT"" much bigger and they even help with security in the case u drop ur phone and need some extra help keeping ur phone looking nice. When u buy a larger one It will hold the sturdiness better and also b a ton more comfortable. Truly a win/win. In conclusion I can NOT recommend this product at this time. Save ur money.

8993334,2.0,"Nice looking and slim, but doesn't age well and buttons suck","Clear case shows off that beautiful nylon, baby! Textured sides keep the phone in your hands Slim, and generally nice looking -Makes the volume and power buttons hard to press -The plastic started yellowing after a month or so -Dust and other gunk sneak under the edge of the case My phone needs a case. In my youth I thought otherwise, but after dropping and cracking the screens on four (count 'em, 4) consecutive phones, I've accepted that I am a klutz, that I am prone to dropping things, and that, as such, my phone needs a case. No one wants to cover up the Ballistic Nylon on this beautiful beast, though, so I set out to find a transparent case and tried out this one. It was.. okay. First impressions: Slim and adds very little bulk to the phone. The sides have a rough, grippy texture which help keep it in your hands (obviously a boon for this reviewer's butterfingers). And obviously, it's transparent but only partially (the Amazon image is pretty accurate). It feels nice in your hand, especially with the cutout over the Motorola & 34;M& 34; creating a natural resting place for your finger on the back of the phone. After a few minutes, though, you realize the buttons on this case aren't very good. You have to press quite hard, but mostly they don't give you much feedback. You can't feel much of a & 34;click& 34; when you depress the button. Often I'd have to press the power button twice because (apparently) I hadn't pressed hard enough the first time. It's a very mild but very frequent annoyance and I almost returned the case after two weeks. Still, I stuck around for another month because I wanted a transparent case, dammit. But then the plastic started yellowing, and I found that I was always cleaning pocket-lint that got stuck right under the edge of the case.

The textured area is actually a little ""slicker"" than the clear area, but that's not a big deal to me either. I love that the cover fully-covers the switches, so that they are less likely to get dirt/dust in there.. that's why I specifically chose such a case.. and it delivered perfectly on this promise.

9331541,5.0,Exactly what I expected and wanted.,"Ok, received the case yesterday and it is exactly what I expected. It fit my phone perfectly. It adds no noticeable weight to the phone and is thin enough that it really doesn't add extra bulk. It has good grip - enough that it will not slip out of your hand unless you almost completely open your fingers. Had no trouble at all connecting the charger or headphones. (Don't have a Qi charger, so I can't comment on that) It looks exactly like the picture - you can clearly see the nylon pattern through the clear sections and the frosted part is just that. And of course, the price is right (just under $10 when I got mine) - The side buttons are slightly more difficult to use with the case on, but just barely, and not much worse than any other case I've used. Note: This case is designed to fit the Droid Turbo Ballistic Nylon phone, which from the research I've done is slightly thicker than the Metalized Glass Fiber backed Droid Turbo phones. So if you have an MGF model, this case may not fit right, which may also explain some of the 1 ratings complaining that it doesn't fit. Also: It is a thin case, so obviously there is a trade off on protection. It will protect against nicks and dings from everyday use, but if you drop it there is not much between your phone and the ground. Just know going in that if you want great protection, pay for an Otterbox or Lifeproof case. (None of this was enough for me to lower my rating - just good to know before you buy) All-in-all, it is a great case for the price.",[],B00QPAQ09E,B00QPAQ09E,AESRXUF7J55TB7MQBUVVVY7AFR7Q,1429193694000,0,False

11538586,4.0,... different cases for my G4 and they were all super slippery and too thin,"I have tried 4 different cases for my G4 and they were all super slippery and too thin. The phone itself is so slim and slippery, for me anyway, that I need something to add just a bit of thickness to it. This case is not soft rubber, but I don't understand the reviews that say it's hard to grip.The sides have the cut ins that make this case the only one so far, that is easily gripped no matter where it is picked up.The way the case comes together, allows for a small air pocket on the corners to help with absorbing impact. The bezel coverage is just a little less than I would prefer (still being scarred from dropping my Moto X face down onto concrete and shattering the LCD screen), but it's more then the others I have tried. I love the stand and have never had a single issue of it being slippery, that other reviewers seemed to be concerned about. Is this a & 34;cute& 34; case? No. It's a functional case. After losing a phone with a cute case, I wanted functional. The G4 is too large, slim and slippery to not have a case that has & 34;grab-ability& 34;. My husband just bought the G4 and thought maybe it was just bc my hands were smaller that I trouble with the phone without a case and then he realized why I chose this case when he held the phone without one and also when he tried a few of the cases I had rejected. I am in no way saying this is the only great case for the G4 out there. Just saying it is for me and I have tried others that were on all the & 34;recommended& 34; lists. I was also confused by some of the reviews that I was reading about how slippery this case was, when it is not at all with the ability to grip the sides of the phone so easily with the cut ins. EDIT- This case does not fit ALL versions of the Moto G4. I have the Moto G4, the Moto G4 Plus is the exact same configuration only it has the fingerprint scanner. The Moto G4 Play is shaped/configured slightly differently than the Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus.

11998994,4.0,A good niche product,"Summary: This is a good product, but only if you understand what this case is supposed to be. Facts: The case is a flexible, semi-clear rubberized material. It is low profile (so it doesn't add much to the size of the phone), and it has raised screen edges to protect against flat face-down drops. The case also has pebbled strips along the sides for better grip. Flash LEDs, camera lenses, USB/headphone ports are left uncovered, where power button and volume rocker are accessible through raised button-shaped areas. Opinion: I like that this case is slim, simple, and shows off what is a good looking device. I don't like that the flexibility of the case means that (at the right angle) sometimes moisture can get inside if it's raining out. I'm indifferent about the level of actual protection offered (probably not a good idea to do any test drops over 3 feet). The bottom line is that you're not looking at a Lifeproof or Otterbox phone vault; with this case, you're choosing to lose some of that airtight, surefire protection in exchange for something that might be a better fit to the hand, and looks unique/appealing in a world full of handheld pastel-colored bricks.",[],B00QPAQ09E,B00QPAQ09E,AH23QAZLQAAV6GTV2M6DFPSDBP4Q,1448742498000,10,True

13009917,3.0,Better than some good as most cases.,"The case does what it's intended for. That is to say it covers the phone and protects against the general issues like low impact falls, dust, debris, etc. It does not do these any better than most covers but is worth the cost of it if you get free shipping as a Prime member. The case is easy to install, as it comes in two parts which click together easily and feel secure. The case is thin and blends into the lines of the phone just as a good (not great) suit drapes when worn. It's pleasing to the eye since it's thin and, if you purchase it similar or the the same color as your phone, it's practically invisible. The finish is a smooth and rubberized which allows the phone to be held securely while not having to worry about it slipping out of your hand like some hard plastic cases. The case however falls short when dealing with falls from distances higher than 3 feet. I tested this personally on my old iphone 6. The case protected any damage to the phone but not when dropped at anything higher than 3 ft. When I did this the case chipped and the metal on the corner of the phone itself was scraped and slightly dented.
